- docstrings -- add missing ones, revise existing.  doctests?
- docstring for __init__ should be mini-howto
- more schema tests
- better way of constructing adding validators that act on multiple
  keys in a schema; in particular, an ability to add an error associated
  with a different key would be desirable (so, in validator that is given
  both state and country, associate the error with state, rather than with 
  both).  Adding a "key" to the Invalid exception and paying attention to this
  is unpack_errors() might be enough. 
- more room for validators that act at the dictionary level.  Using a class for this, rather than adding things purely functionally, might be helpful.
- unpack_errors() is broken anyway.  Refactor and write tests.
